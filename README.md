This is a Repo holding the Assignments or test programs given by the College in the 5th Semester. We will try to include as much as programs as we can.

### Note

The Repo has both .java and .class files for each program (or as much is possible). There is a guide below on how to compile a .java file and run the .class file.

### How to Compile a Java File?

Open your Terminal/Command Prompt/Powershell window in the repo directory and enter the following command:

```bash
javac fileName.java
```

This will generate a .class file. Now, to run the actual Java Bytecode in your machine, enter the following command:

```bash
java className.class
```
